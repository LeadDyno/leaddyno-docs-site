## Affiliate Compensation

LeadDyno offers you the ability to pay your affiliates in a variety of ways. This guide will take you through paying an affiliate. Paying affiliates is done through the __Pay Affiliate Commissions__ page under __Affiliate Program__ as shown below.

### Manual Affiliate Payments

If you have your own system of paying affiliates, you may choose to mark your affiliate as paid manually. 

To do this, you simply select __Manual__ next to the corresponding commission for an affiliate. To the Affiliate, the commission will now be shown as "Paid". 

#### Handling Erroneous Payments

In the case that a commission is accidentally paid manually, you can simply create a Manual Commission from that Affiliate's page ("Manage Affiliates", then select affiliate email) and then follow the previous steps to pay again.

### Paying Affiliates through Paypal

LeadDyno offers native support of paying affiliates through Paypal.

To do so, simply select the __Paypal__ button next to the affiliate's commission log and it will prompt you to log in to your Paypal account. 

__Note__: The affiliate's email is the same email Paypal will send payments to. 

### Paying Affiliates through Dwolla

LeadDyno offers the ability to pay affiliates through an integration with Dwolla. Simply go to __Manage Integrations__ under __Settings__ and select the __Payment Services Tab__ (as shown below), click __Connect to Dwolla__ and follow the instructions to integrate.

After successfully connecting to Dwolla, it will appear as an option for compensation similar to Paypal. When you pay an affiliate via the Dwolla button, it will also pay your user based on their affiliate email.
