## Bold Cashier Integration Guide

### Introduction

LeadDyno offers a One-click integration with the Bold Cashier e-commerce checkout system. At this time, LeadDyno
only supports Bold Cashier on the Shopify platform.

Before connecting the Bold Cashier integration, make sure you have already connected your LeadDyno account to 
your Shopify store. You can confirm this by looking at your list of installed apps from your Shopify administration
dashboard, or looking at the list of existing LeadDyno installed apps/integrations and seeing the Shopfiy integration
listed as connected. For more help, see our [Shopify Integration Guide](https://docs.leaddyno.com/shopify-integration-guide.html).

Also, make sure you are already logged into the Shopify admin panel for the store you are adding the Bold Cashier
integration.
