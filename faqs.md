<a class="docs-anchor" id='affiliate_login'> </a>
#### How can my affiliates log in to their dashboard? 

Affiliates have two main options of logging into their dashboards. On creation, you may send them a signup email that includes a direct sign-in link to their dashboard. As long as they keep this link, they can get in. Additionally, they have the ability to set up a username and password for authentication purposes. In the case of a forgotten password, they can use the retreival system OR the account manager can log in for them to change their password.

<a class="docs-anchor" id='affiliate_code'> </a>
#### How can I change the affiliate code? 

You have the ability to edit the code for each affiliate on the 'Manage Affiliate' page. Our codes must always start with a pound sign (#) and must then follow the pattern _a letter_code. For example: http://www.leaddyno.com/#_a_affiliatecode 

In addition, we allow you to choose to use query parameters instead of codes by selecting the corresponding setting on the [settings page](https://app.leaddyno.com/settings/account).

#### Is shipping or taxes included in my commissions?

With any of our one click integrations, it is not considered when factoring a commission or showing prices. For example, if you sell something for $17.00 and shipping is $5.00, you will only ever see $17.00 in LeadDyno. For custom integrations and Infusionsoft, we take the whole purchase with shipping and taxes.
