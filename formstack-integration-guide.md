## Formstack Integration Guide

LeadDyno integrates easily with Formstack forms.  Below are the easy steps to do so.

### Copy Tracking Code From LeadDyno

First you will need to copy the tracking code from leaddyno.  Simply go to this page:

[https://app.leaddyno.com/tools](https://app.leaddyno.com/tools)

Make sure that "Automatically Track Lead Forms" is checked and click **Copy Code**.

### Add to your Formstack Form

Next you will need to add a javascript element to the form that you wish to track.

Drag a "script" element onto your form, and ensure that there is an email field on the form.  LeadDyno requires
an email field in order to properly track leads.
