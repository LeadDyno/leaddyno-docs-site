### Coupon Code Integration

In order to track affiliates by coupon code with Ecwid, LeadDyno automatically uploads each new affiliate as a new Ecwid
coupon, using their affiliate code as the new coupon code. You can adjust the default settings for these new coupons
by clicking the **Manage** button.

Choose the discount type and amount, then click **Save**. 

That's all there is to it!

### Conclusion

At this point your Ecwid shop will be fully integrated with LeadDyno, which will track the source of all incoming leads,
including affiliates and tracking campaigns. New affiliates will automatically create a coupon in Ewcid that can be
used by affiliates. Orders using the affiliate's coupon will be credited to that affiliate.
